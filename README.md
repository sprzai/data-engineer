# Data Engineering Repository

This repository is a showcase of my work as a Data Engineer. It contains examples of ETLs written in Python, SQL queries, Spark code, AWS scripts, and data architectures.

## Python ETLs

The [python](./python) directory contains Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) scripts I've written in Python. These scripts demonstrate my ability to gather and clean data, and to move it from one place to another.

## SQL Queries

In the [sql](./sql) directory you will find a series of SQL queries I have written. These examples showcase my ability to manipulate and extract information from databases using SQL.

## Spark Code

The [spark](./spark) directory includes examples of Spark code I have written to process large data sets. Here, my understanding of parallel data processing and my ability to write efficient Spark jobs is demonstrated.

## AWS Scripts

The [aws](./aws) directory contains various scripts that I have written to interact with AWS services. These scripts demonstrate my ability to work with the AWS cloud and my understanding of various AWS services, including S3, Glue, Redshift, Athena, Kinesis, EMR, and Data Pipeline.

## Data Architectures

In the [architecture](./architecture) directory, you can find diagrams and descriptions of various data architectures I have designed. These examples show how I would organize resources to handle, process, and analyze large volumes of data.
